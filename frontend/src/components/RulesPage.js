        <h2>General</h2>
        <li>Teams start with €20 in the bank</li>
        <li>Each team must take a rest period of 9hrs every night, starting between 9pm and 12pm</li>
        <li>Must announce claim within 5 mins of arriving at station</li>
        <li>Bonus Sites give extra 100km</li>
        <h2>Challenge Cards</h2>
        <li>You need to complete at least one card before moving on a route you are claiming.</li>
        <li>You cannot leave a city with a challenge card drawn but not completed or vetoed (unless you have purchased the holster).</li>
        <li>For the avoidance of doubt, you cannot complete any cards whilst travelling between cities. If you complete a challenge outside of the city in which you started the challenge, you must return to that city before starting another route.</li>
        <li>If teams are on the same train, then first to complete a challenge claims the route (this counts as the card draw needed to move on)</li>
        <li>Cards can only be completed in cities, and can only be drawn after 30 minutes before projected arrival of a train that is a claimable route or in the city</li>
        <li>If you've drawn a specific card already drawn in that city, then redraw.</li>
        <li>Challenge cards can be vetoed for a 30 minute penalty, players can move within the city in this time but they must return to the veto position 30 minutes later, and may not draw another card. You cannot veto a card when on a train</li>
        <li>Some cards have time exceptions. If the card is drawn outside the hours on the card, you can re-draw a card. If you draw the card on a train, use the train's projected arrival time at that moment as the "draw time"</li>

          <tr>
            <td>3rd challenge in city</td>
            <td>-10%</td>
          </tr>

          </tr>
        <h2>Costs</h2>
        <li>Costs for transport outside of the main routes (i.e. not covered by interrail pass), and for routes not being claimed (i.e. already claimed) are still are deducted from bank. Transport is public transport only (including bikes/scooters). Intercity travel is via train only.</li>
        <li>Costs for accomodation, food, and for seat reservations do not affect bank</li>
        <h2>Purchasing train tickets</h2>
        <li>When a ticket is "purchased", the arrival time is set at the scheduled/projected arrival time of that train. For every minute (after 15 minutes) that you arrive after that pre-set arrival time at your destination (due exclusively to train delays) you will accrue one minute in a veto bank, that can be used to reduce veto time for future challenge card draws.</li>
        <li>Once a ticket is purchased, it cannot be refunded. If a train is delayed, the ticket can transfer to another train on the same route (same rules apply above even if you change the train you travel on). If the train is cancelled or there is not another train to your destination which will arrive within 90 minutes of your original scheduled/projected arrival time, you may take a refund.</li>
        <h3>If in doubt about any rules, ask on the central Whatsapp group to discuss with all teams</h3>
